Software Development Lifecycle

User needs are vitally important to software development. Users are a products lifeline as they are who will be buying the products which in turn keeps the development company in business. In order to interpret user needs and implement them into development, the use of user stories assists greatly. Being able to see what kind of feature a user is looking to have in the product, and what they want to be able to do with that product ensures that the development team can adaquately implement and test new features. When it comes to my own approach to developing programs, I like to break down projects into smaller portions to make it easier to manage. This fit very well in this class due to the involvement of agile methodologies being the centerpoint for this class. I would like to include more flexability into future development work I do. This will greatly assist me when it comes to coming across roadblocks during development which I can struggle with at times. In order to be a good team member in software development, I believe that communication is the most important thing to keep in mind. Being able to communicate effectively with your team what you're able to do, what you have done, and any questions you have will greatly improve the quality and quantity of work completed by the team.
